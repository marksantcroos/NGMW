Next Generation Middleware for Distributed Exascale Computing
Infrastructure: The Role of Modeling and Simulation

Abstract: 

Distributed Exascale Computing (DEC) is an important complementary and
synergistic pathway to deliver science at the exascale.  The
integration between single leadership machines and larger number of
less powerful machines is necessary to promote efficient resource
utilization and support multi-phase applications. Enabling a
multi-level solution that integrates adaptive applications and dynamic
resource management capabilities at extreme-scales is laden with many
challenges, some of which can be addressed by a fresh perspective to
distributed middleware. For example, there is a need to move beyond
middleware that only supports simple execution of jobs to one that has
first-class support for well-defined "capabilities" and "enables
reasoning about whether to distribute a workload or not, and if so,
how and when to distribute?‚Äù. We will derive and outline some
properties of such a "next-generation middleware" for DEC, sketch a
possible architecture and discuss the role of simulation and modeling
at each layer of the middleware stack.
